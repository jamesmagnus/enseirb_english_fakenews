      <h2>Why this website?</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-7"><p>With the recent democratization of social medias, it gets easier and faster to spread information over the internet. These new tools have entirely reshaped our relation with information because most of the people that are using these networks aren’t experienced to deal with informations, and this inability is exacerbated by the overwhelming presence of information on their news feed. We can’t control the way information fluctuates on the internet so we must change the way people behave when confronted to those informations.</p></div>
