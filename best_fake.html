      <h2>A list of our prefered fake news</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://cnn.com.de/news/obama-signs-executive-order-banning-pledge-allegiance-schools-nationwide/">Obama Signs Executive Order Banning The Pledge Of Allegiance In Schools Nationwide</a></li>
        <p>It's a total hoax as <a href="http://www.snopes.com/pledge-of-allegiance-ban/">snopes has spotted.</a></p>
        <li><a href="http://viralmugshot.com/trump-offering-free-one-way-tickets-to-africa-mexico-for-those-who-wanna-leave-america/">Trump Offering Free One-Way Tickets to Africa & Mexico for Those Who Wanna Leave America</a></li>
        <p>This story received a lot of likes on Facebook but is in fact totally fake: <a href="http://www.businessinsider.fr/uk/spot-the-fake-news-story-2017-2/#4-fake-essex-villages-high-easter-and-good-easter-forced-to-change-offensive-names-after-complaints-4">source</a></p>
        <li><a href="http://www.firealive.it/rage-against-the-machine-to-reunite-and-release-anti-donald-trump-album/">RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE To Reunite And Release Anti Donald Trump Album</a></li>
        <p>This one was made for good reasons trying to put obstacles on Trump way. But it remains a fake news.</p>
        <li><a href="https://thevalleyreport.com/2016/02/13/florida-man-dies-in-meth-lab-explosion-after-lighting-farts-on-fire/">Florida man dies in meth-lab explosion after lighting farts on fire</a></li>
        <p>This one is very funny but totally false. Again <a href="http://www.snopes.com/meth-lab-explosion-gas/">snopes explainations</a> are there to help you. Notice that <em>the valley report</em> states clearly some of their story are “exaggerated,” “embellished,” or simply pure “fiction”</p>
