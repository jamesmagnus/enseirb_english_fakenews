        Our guide to help you deciding if a suspect news if a fake or not. The following rules are called the 5 big rules of trust.
      </div>
      <ol id="rules">
        <li>Admit that you don't think before you click</li>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-7">
            <p>This first rule is about <strong>not</strong> sharing a news on social network <strong>without</strong> having read it before. This comportement is a real problem as <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/03/avoiding-articles-from-the-creep-people-trust-news-based-on-who-shared-it-not-on-who-published-it/">a 2016 study by the US-based Media Insight Project revealed</a>&nbsp;that “<em>people trust news based on who shared it, not on who published it.</em>”<br>If you don't have time to check the article just don't re-share it. Following this rule you limit fake news propagation to your friends.<br>So, take note: “<em>If you're not sure, don't share.</em>”</p></div>
          <div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-1">
            <img src="img/share.png" />
          </div>
        </div>
        <li>Mind the date</li>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-7">
            <p>Some fake news are not exactly fake but old real news twisted to serve a new case. Some politic people use news happened years ago as it is related to current events. To avoid being trapped by this trick, <strong>always</strong> check the date of the article.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-1">
            <img src="img/date.jpg" />
          </div>
        </div>
        <li>Seek an nth opinion</li>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-7">
            <p>Sometimes a news can contain an unintentional error even when the source is a perfectly trusted and serious one. Everyone knows how an errorneous news is painful. Hopefully there is a simple way to eliminate errors: <strong>check other sources.</strong> If you can find the same information in at least 2 other sources it's ok. Remember these sources should met the others rules of this guide.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
          <li>Wait it out</li>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-7">
              <p>When breaking news come out, all press agencies want to be first, so they sacrified the story accuracy for being first. Don't be crushed by the pressure, wait 24h for more details and compare sources. Nobody will blame for not sharing an news when it's out.</p>

          <li>Elevate your mind</li>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-7">
              <p>News articles are not the only sources of information. You can find more precise data on institutional website, you can call offices, or go and check the facts yourself in the field. Remeber constant incoming news sometimes polluted your mind instead of enlighting it. You will detect fake news more easily if you know what's going on in the real world.</p>
